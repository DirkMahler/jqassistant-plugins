== Find package dependencies in the wrong direction

The desired package dependencies are described in an Asciidoc document
which also contains PlantUML package diagrams. These diagrams were
imported into the jQAssistant database. The following Concepts and
Constraints were neede to find dependencies in the wrong direction.

[[package:PackageLevel]]
.Set the level property of a package, e.g. 1 for de, 2 for de.kontext_e and so on.
[source,cypher,role=concept,requiresConcepts="dependency:Package"]
----
MATCH
    (p:Java:Package)
WITH
    SPLIT(p.fqn,".") AS splitted, p
SET
    p.level=SIZE(splitted)
RETURN
    splitted, SIZE(splitted);
----

[[dependency:TransitivePackageDependencies]]
.Add a DEPENDS_ON relationship to parents of a package P from other packages up to the same level of the source package.
[source,cypher,role=concept,requiresConcepts="package:PackageLevel"]
----
MATCH
    (p:Java:Package)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(p2:Java:Package),
    (parent:Java:Package)-[:CONTAINS*]->(p2:Java:Package)
WHERE
    p.level <= parent.level
CREATE UNIQUE
    (p)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(parent)
RETURN
    p.fqn, parent.fqn;
----

[[dependency:WrongDirection]]
.Finds package dependencies which are in the wrong direction according to the documentation.
[source,cypher,role=constraint,requiresConcepts="dependency:TransitivePackageDependencies",severity=critical]
----
MATCH
    (p1:PlantUml:Package)-[:MAY_DEPEND_ON]->(p2:PlantUml:Package),
    (p3:Java:Package)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(p4:Java:Package)
WHERE
    p1.fqn = p4.fqn
    AND p2.fqn = p3.fqn
RETURN
    p3.fqn + "-->" + p4.fqn AS WrongDirection;
