<<JavaParserScanner>>
[[JavaParserScanner]]

== Use JavaParser for scanning Java source files
Accepts all files with the file suffix '.java'.

!! *WARNING* !!
This is a highly experimental plugin. Schema and stored data may change in every upcoming release.
So use it to play around, try it out and give me feedback. I'll be happy to hear how it can be
improved.

This plugin does not provide a defined schema. Instead it uses JavaParser metadata to store the AST
as graph. Try ':JavaSource' label and 'SUBNODE' and 'SUBLIST' relationships for exploring the graph.
